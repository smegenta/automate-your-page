		      		<p> A Markup element is made of an opening tag, a content and closing tags. Opening tags may have values. Some markups do not have contants and are said to be void markups. Void tags do not need closing tag. </p>

		      		<p>Some example of tags:</p>
		      		<ul>
		      			<li><b><span class="code">&#60;a&#62;</span></b> - anchor for making links <br>
		      			<li><b><span class="code">&#60;img&#62;</span></b> - for images and has src and alt attributes<br>

		      			<li><b><span class="code">&#60;p&#62;</span></b> - make paragraphs

		      		<p>The difference between the line break and paragraph tag is that the first one is an inline tag while the latter is a block tag. </p>

		  			<p> The objective of this section is to learn the Python programming language to generate the html page for the webpage we are building. In doing so, we will lean how to make a computer do what it is best at, which is doing repititive tasks very quickly.</p>

		  			<p><b>A Computer </b> - A computer is a universal machine that can be programmed to do any computation.</p>

		  			<p><b>A Program </b> - A program is a sequence of steps that tells the computer what to do. There are many different languages for programming computer. One of these languages is called Python </p>

		  			<p><b>Python </b> - Python is a high level programming language. Python is called interpretor becuase it interprests the program we write to a language the computer understands and executes it. </p>

		  			<p> A computer program need to be unambigious so that the computer executes exactly the same thing the programmer wants it to do. Unlike human languages, which tends to be verbose, a computer program has to describe its instruction consisely. Like human languages, computer programming languages also have grammars, but unlike human languages, they have to be followed precisely.</p>

		  			<p>Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.</p>
		  			<p>Strings:</p>
		  			<ul>
		  				<li> - Both single and double quotes can be used, as long as opening and closing quotes are the same.
		  				<li> - Strings can be assigned to variables. 
		  				<li> - '+' operator for stings is a concatenation operator. It concatenates two strings into a new string.
		  				<li> - In Python '=' is an assignment statement, not an equal sign.
		  			</ul>
		  			<p>We can not use the '+' operators with strings and numbers , but "*" can be used and it means repeating the string as many times as specified in the operation. </p>

		  			<p>Individual characters within a string can be accessed by the index [] operator. Index starts from 0. We can also have negative index numbers. When used, they mean to start at the end of the string and go to the left. </p>

		  			<p>The operator <span class="code"> string[exp1:exp2] </span> is used to select a substring of a string starting at index exp1 and ending at index (exp2-1)</p>

		  			<p>The find method <span class="code"> string.find(sub_string) </span> can be used to find the first occurnace of the substring in a string. By adding one more paramter <span class="code"> string.find(sub_string, position) </span>, the find method can be used to find the occurance of the sub string after the specified position of the string. This is useful when we are interested in finding multiple occurences. </p>

		  			<ul>
		  				<li>- Look at the Traceback error message.
		  				<li>- Use commenting to help you identify the location.
		  				<li>- Use print statements
